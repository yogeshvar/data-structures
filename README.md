# Welcome to the just-stuff wiki!

I'm Yogesh, yet another developer working at Gyanmatrix. I have always wanted to start competitive programming but did not give it a try. 

Thanks to COVID because finally, this quarantine has made me give a head start on my competitive programming. 

Back to the main story, I have created this repository just to record/note/ any useful information/solutions/data-structures used which might be useful in the future.
